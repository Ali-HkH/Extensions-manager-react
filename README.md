## The challenge

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Your challenge is to build out this browser extension manager UI and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to: 

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
